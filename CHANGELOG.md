# LoreFell Forge Change Log

Build batches pushed to this repo, newest at the top. The apply workflow is manual, so a push here changes the repo only. Collections change in Wix when the apply workflow runs.

---

## 2026-06-24 — BrandForge: lineage images above the text

- Lineage catalog cards now show the image full width above the text on desktop and mobile, sized to fit the horizontal image instead of a cropped left thumbnail

## 2026-06-24 — Revert createCollection id change

- The Wix v2 create API keys the collection on id, not _id. Reverted so collection creation succeeds again

## 2026-06-24 — Fix collection creation field types

- createCollection now sends the collection _id rather than id, so the field schema registers on create and new collections get typed fields instead of undefined ones
- Lineages seed no longer writes an empty image value, so the image field is not inferred as text

## 2026-06-24 — BrandForge catalog cleanup

- Catalog now shows canon lineages only, so community and test submissions no longer duplicate entries without descriptions
- Removed the Base a lineage on this button from catalog cards; the catalog is a read reference
- Removed The Unwritten from the catalog and seed; the Forge submission flow is the build-your-own path

## 2026-06-24 — BrandForge aligned, wired, with a Lineages catalog

- Top-level Catalog and Forge tabs; the existing builder (Submit one / Stratum, Lineage / World / Brand) lives under Forge
- Subtitle removed; sticky submit bar moved into normal flow so there is no reserved white space at the bottom
- Image upload added to World and Brand, not just Lineage
- Submissions now go to the shared Creations collection tagged brandforge with kind lineage, world, or brand, through a new page bridge, replacing the old three-collection plan
- New Lineages catalog (37 lineages sourced from the FellGuide) read live through getCatalog; community lineage submissions show with author and a submitted note; Base a lineage on this seeds the Forge
- New: schemas/Lineages.json, schemas/seed/Lineages.json, brandforge ForgeConfig row, velo/page-brandforge.js

## 2026-06-24 — RelicForge: catalog images resized

- Catalog cards now place the image as a fixed thumbnail to the left of the text on desktop, and above the text on mobile, instead of one oversized full-width image

## 2026-06-24 — RelicForge aligned, wired, and imaged

- Gold Forge wordmark, subtitle and divider removed, body reset so there is no white space around the embed
- Catalog and Forge are two tabs at every width; the desktop two-column split is gone, single column tuned for mobile
- Catalog now reads the live Relics collection through a page bridge and falls back to the built-in set if the bridge is not wired; community submissions show with author and a Submitted badge
- Added image upload on the Forge form and image display on catalog cards
- New: schemas/Relics.json, schemas/seed/Relics.json (58 relics), relicforge ForgeConfig row, velo/page-relicforge.js

## 2026-06-24 — ShardForge masthead promoted to the gold wordmark

- ShardForge is now the large Shard plus gold Forge title, with Infusions or Augmentations as a small label beneath it
- Removed the lede description lines on both the Infusions and Augmentations sides

## 2026-06-24 — Unified forge wordmark (gold Forge), drop taglines

- FoeForge and SigilForge now render the name with Forge in gold to match BondForge
- Removed the tagline lines under the title on FoeForge (build a Foe once...) and BondForge (Lorebound Aspects) to tighten the masthead
- Convention for new forges: wordmark Name plus Forge in gold, no subtitle line

## 2026-06-24 — BondForge: lorebound image fits the card on mobile

- On phones, a lorebound card with an image now sizes to the image, so a horizontal portrait fills the width with no empty space above and below. The fixed box stays only for the letter fallback when there is no image

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: Deploy-at defaults to Minion

- render now re-syncs the Deploy-at select to state every pass, so Consult, Load, New Foe, and Random no longer leave it stale
- Random Foe no longer randomizes the deploy tier; At the table always starts at Minion until you change it

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: clearer all-tier table

- Split the cryptic R/D column into labeled React and Disc columns with a check mark, and added a one line legend explaining Attr, Vit, Acts, Inf, React, and Disc

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: complete stat cards, offline Random

- The stat card now falls back to an act's library effect when a manually picked act carries none, so the block is always complete
- Random Foe no longer waits on the AI. It shapes the build and names locally and forges acts only for tiers the library cannot fill. With a full act library it is instant and needs no network

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: all-tier view, clone, stat card, random

- Card back now shows an Every tier table: attribute value, vitality, acts live, and infusions live at each Shatter Rating, with the deployed tier highlighted
- Save as new clones the current build into a fresh saved Foe without touching the one it came from
- Stat card builds a clean read-aloud block of the whole Foe with a Copy button, ready for the table or an external HUD
- Random Foe forges a complete legal Foe from a random theme and tier through the same pipeline as Consult

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: New Foe reset

- Added a New Foe button that clears the builder back to blank, including name, arsenal, acts, description, image, and the loaded Foe link. The act library stays loaded. It arms on first tap and clears on the second so nothing is wiped by accident

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: saved Foes persist with their forged acts

- Save to my Foes now writes a private record keyed to the member, isolated from the Pentifax ledger. Forged acts kept to the Foe ride along in the save, so they come back when you reopen it, button state and all
- Added a My saved Foes list with Load and Delete. Loading restores the full build, the description, and the local forged acts. Saving an already loaded Foe updates it in place
- Backend saveFoe, myFoes, deleteFoe added

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: forged acts stay local, opt-in to LoreForge

- The forge no longer auto-submits AI acts. A built act is kept to the Foe by default and listed under Forged Acts with a Send to LoreForge button, so a loremaster shares it only if they want it. An act that already exists in LoreForge is reused, not duplicated
- Much richer flavor coverage. buildLegalAct now maps a wide vocabulary (fire, fear, bleed, rot, poison, mind, madness, curse, luck, bind, slow, weaken, frost, maim, light, shadow, cut, blunt, wither, expose, strip, dispel, frenzy, mark, shatter, corrupt, and more) to real afflictions, with Major afflictions used at Tier 3 where they fit. Every mapping is validated legal and in band

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: AI acts built from real components

- The AI no longer writes act mechanics. It names a custom act, gives a one word flavor, and a short description. The new backend buildLegalAct assembles the act from real SigilForge components, validates it against the shared rules, and keeps the cost inside the tier band. The effect text comes from the component descriptions
- FoeForge submits these real component builds to LoreForge, so a generated act follows the ruleset exactly instead of inventing effects

## 2026-06-24 — Authored creations pass validation

- The shared rule interpreter now accepts an authored creation. It skips the component slot and gate checks and validates only against the tier cost band. This lets the FoeForge AI write a legal ability or spell and submit it to LoreForge without filling SigilForge's Damage, Targeting, and Inlay slots
- Regenerated docs/rules.js and velo/backend/rules.js from rules.core.js. FoeForge custom acts now post with authored true

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: flip card, AI invents and submits acts

- Consult now invents legal acts when the catalog cannot fill a tier. Abilities for Power builds, spells for Magic builds, costs kept in the tier band. New ones auto-submit to LoreForge, and an existing one of the same name is reused instead of duplicated
- The Foe Card flips. Front holds the arsenal, the image, and the description. Back holds the table-side stats with the deploy controls on top. A flip button works on desktop and mobile
- Moved the Description box up to the old Validation slot and moved Validation directly above Save. Removed the live-tool note. Party level now defaults to 1

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: stricter legality, Foe descriptions

- A legal Foe now needs three infusions, two augmentations, and one Act at each tier (T1, T2, T3). Builds with no attack attribute still carry no infusions
- Consult and the offline shaping now produce a full legal arsenal so a forged Foe validates on the first pass
- Added a Description field. The AI writes it during Consult, the way SigilForge does for abilities, and it shows on the Foe card and in the Pentifax ledger

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: AI forges the whole arsenal

- Consult from description now has the AI choose build, stance, affliction, infusions, augmentations, and acts from the live catalogs, not just the name. The pick is validated and trimmed if anything is illegal. Offline it falls back to the local shaping
- Removed the Core and Non-Core label from augmentations. The validator never used it
- Pills now use touch-action manipulation and a tap highlight so the tap-to-reveal fires cleanly on mobile

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: mobile-readable descriptions

- Infusion and augmentation picker rows now show their effect inline, matching the Acts rows, so descriptions are visible on touch without a hover
- Result pills (card, ledger, selected, stance, affliction, acts) reveal their description on tap, with a tap elsewhere to dismiss. Native hover is kept for desktop

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: the Pentifax ledger

- Added a Forge / Pentifax tabbar. The Pentifax tab lists submitted Foes with All, Canon, and Mine filters and a vote button, matching the other forge ledgers
- Each entry shows stance, affliction, infusions, augmentations, and acts as pills with hover tooltips, plus a Canon or Submitted badge and the author
- page-foeforge.js answers FOE_LOAD_LEDGER and FOE_VOTE

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge card polish and standard attack bonus damage

- Foe card relabels Signature to Affliction. Stance and Affliction now render as pills with hover tooltips, matching infusions and augmentations
- Standard Attack now lists Bonus Damage alongside Base Damage, both drawn from Power or Magic depending on the build
- Fixed the indent on the empty acts message

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: selection descriptions, hover tooltips, creative consult names

- Stance and Signature Affliction now show the selected option's effect under the box. Build keeps its line
- Infusions, augmentations, and acts show their effect on hover, on the picker rows, the selected pills, and the Foe card
- Consult names a foe through the forge AI with a richer local fallback, so a shadow demon stops coming back as The Demon

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge: blank start, live abilities only, provenance badges, full text

- Removed the demo foe. The builder opens blank, no name and no preset infusions, augmentations, or acts
- Dropped the sample act list. Acts now come only from SigilForge submissions, submitted and canonized, with an empty state when none exist
- Each ability, infusion, and augmentation carries a Canon or Submitted badge
- Abilities show their full description, not the shorthand. getCreations now returns fullText

## 2026-06-24 — FoeForge wired: submit to the Pentifax, builder reads live components

- Submit routes a foe to the Pentifax, the foe canon hall (Creations, kind foe, meta hall pentifax). Save stays private and local
- The builder reads abilities, infusions, and augmentations, official and submitted. Infusions and augmentations come from their collections plus ShardForge submissions, abilities from SigilForge creations
- Live components feed the pickers and the client validator. The baked pack and sample acts remain as an offline fallback
- Added a foeforge ForgeConfig row, loremaster access. Ability cost defaults to the tier minimum since SigilForge does not store a numeric cost yet

## 2026-06-24 — BondForge portraits no longer click to enlarge

- Removed the in-place zoom from catalog, ledger, and preview portraits. They fill their panel and do nothing on tap

## 2026-06-24 — Add SYNC_RUNBOOK for a two-token chat

- Documented the full loop a chat with forge and vault tokens follows: edit vault canon, regenerate seed, push both, dispatch the Apply Action for Wix
- Spelled out what is automatic (Pages, seed via Action) and what is manual (Velo paste)

## 2026-06-23 — Infusion gem icon; FellGuide as source for the collections

- ShardForge infusions now show a faceted gem. Augmentations keep the shield
- Added canonFromVault.js: reads hidden source docs in the vault (_Canon/collections) into the CMS seed, then apply pushes to Wix. One way, the vault is never written to
- Portraits are never emitted, so manual Wix uploads survive every sync (upsertItems merges)
- Added npm run canon and npm run sync. Source docs and a governance note live in the vault

## 2026-06-23 — BondForge cards: larger left-half portrait, click to zoom in place

- Catalog and ledger portraits now fill the left half of the card and stretch to its height
- Clicking a portrait expands it in place inside the card and shows the full uncropped image. Clicking again collapses it
- Removed the fixed centered lightbox, which anchored to the middle of the embed iframe and forced scrolling

## 2026-06-23 — Canon moves to editable CMS collections

- Added three content collections you edit in the CMS: Lorebounds, Infusions, Augmentations. Real columns plus a native Image field, created and seeded by the apply pipeline
- Added a generic backend read getCatalog(collectionId). Sorts by displayOrder and converts Wix image fields to URLs. Any forge can use it
- BondForge catalog now reads Lorebounds. ShardForge catalog reads Infusions and Augmentations per side. Baked sets remain only as an offline fallback
- Retired the earlier Creations-based bond seed and its endpoint

## 2026-06-23 — BondForge catalog reads canon from the CMS

- Catalog now loads canon lorebounds from the Creations collection (kind bond, canonStatus canon) through getCreations. The baked 18 remain only as an offline fallback
- page-bondforge.js handles CATALOG_LOAD and returns canon rows normalized for the catalog
- Added backend/canonBonds.js (the 18 canon bonds) and a guarded /_functions/seedBonds endpoint to load them once. Idempotent
- Portrait convention still applies: a canon row with no imageUrl falls back to bonds/<slug> art, then the letter

## 2026-06-23 — BondForge: ledger, voting, submission to the LoreForge

- Wired the BondForge lorebound generator to the shared backend (forgeKey bondforge, kind bond)
- Added a Ledger tab to view, vote, and review submissions (All / Canon / Mine)
- Submit now routes to the vault through page-bondforge.js and submitCreation. Portrait uploads reuse the rune uploader, set as the creation image
- Added a bondforge ForgeConfig row with an empty ruleset. No backend change, kind already generalized

## 2026-06-23 — ShardForge: desktop reveals Canonize on click

- Desktop now shows the catalog alone by default. The Canonize column appears on the right only when its tab is clicked, and the Ledger takes the full width when active

## 2026-06-23 — ShardForge: one tool for infusions and augmentations

- Folded augmentations into the ShardForge tool with an Infusions / Augmentations toggle up top
- Each side carries its own catalog, categories, and copy. Augmentations keep the Core-first view and Core badge; infusions show the full set
- One shared Ledger that follows the active side (kind infusion or augmentation), same All / Canon / Mine and voting
- No backend change. page-shardforge.js already keys kind off the side

## 2026-06-23 — ShardForge: ledger, voting, submission to the LoreForge

- Wired the ShardForge infusions tool to the shared backend (forgeKey shardforge, kind infusion)
- Added a Ledger tab to view, vote, and review submissions (All / Canon / Mine), mirroring SigilForge
- Submission now posts to the vault through page-shardforge.js and submitCreation instead of a mock
- Generalized submitCreation kind to payload.kind so any forge sets its own (no SigilForge change)
- Added a shardforge ForgeConfig row with an empty ruleset so freeform submissions validate cleanly

## 2026-06-22 — SigilForge: remove false innate trigger, clarify Base Damage

- Innate weapon afflictions trigger on a 6 for every Form. Removed the incorrect 3rd Form 5-or-6 trigger from the tool and the FellGuide
- Base Damage shows cost -1 directly. Dropped the confusing gain a point wording (no modifier was ever applied)

## 2026-06-22 — SigilForge balance pass

- No Damage cost 0 to -2; Purged 1 to 2; Persecuted* 4 to 3 (no longer Major)
- Enfeebled*, Suppressed*, Disarmed* 3 to 4 (now Major Afflictions, Tier 3 + 3rd Form)
- Crushed may now be carried by Spread and named by Amplify (removed from both ban lists)
- All Enemies renamed All Targets; rule now covers all enemies or all allies
- Inert*, Anchored*, Benighted*, Defanged* marked Foe-only (FoeOnly), rejected on Ability and Spell builds in the tool and the validator
- Monster tab relabeled Foe (internal value unchanged)

## 2026-06-21 — SigilForge: Inlay labels, remix + AI fixes, ledger voting

- Renamed the two slot labels from Rider Slot to Inlay Slot (player-facing copy)
- AI Forge now resolves near-miss component names (e.g. Ignited -> Ignited*) and surfaces truly unknown names to the validator loop, so the chosen Inlay no longer drops silently
- Forge from this now loads pre-meta creations by defaulting the weapon/focus, so the build restores and the player re-picks the item
- Added a Vote control to each ledger card (castVote backend, one vote per member via optional voters field, graceful tally-only fallback)

## 2026-06-21 — SigilForge: AI Forge live, Codex category arrows

- Enabled Forge From a Vision (AI_FORGE_ENDPOINT -> apex /_functions/aiForge); card now shows
- Added left/right arrows to the Component Codex category filter row (desktop; touch-scroll on mobile)

## 2026-06-20 — C3: The Forging Ledger, browse and remix

- The Ledger tab now browses the LoreForge through getCreations instead of repeating the component costs the Codex already carries. Filters for All, Canon, and Mine.
- Each entry shows its canon track (Canon, In Vote, Submitted, Declined, Draft) and a Gate 2 line: canon attaches freely, everything else needs LoreMaster approval to attach.
- Forge from this loads a creation back into the Forge by reusing applyAiBuild, and sets basedOn lineage for the next submission. The forge block now carries an identity meta block so remix restores the weapon, spell, or foe faithfully.
- Page code gained the LOREFELL_LOAD_LEDGER route, member-scoped Mine via currentMember, and stores meta on the record. Backend unchanged, getCreations shipped in C1.

## 2026-06-20 — C2: Bring It To Your LoreMaster

- Submit now opens a review step themed on the canon Bring It To Your LoreMaster section instead of forging straight away.
- The panel shows a legality line (tier, points of cap, Inlays, Afflictions, Legal), the canon Five Questions as a self-check, and a one-line note that becomes creatorNote for the LoreMaster at Gate 2.
- Overlap runs through findSimilar before the send. A close match shows its name, creator, and canon badge, with Base mine on this to set basedOn lineage, or send as new.
- Page code gained the LOREFELL_CHECK_OVERLAP route and now carries creatorNote, narrative flavorText, and basedOn onto the record. No backend change, submitCreation already persists all three.

## 2026-06-20 — C1: SigilForge tool repointed to the vault

- Tool now writes to Creations through submitCreation. It emits a payload.forge block in the interpreter shape (tier, form, mode, kind, selections as labels, spreadTarget, amplifyTarget) and defers the success message to a LOREFELL_SUBMIT_RESULT from the page bridge, so it never claims a save the vault refused.
- Renamed rider to Inlay across all player copy and the AI Forge contract. Code identifiers, CSS classes, and the rune renderer were left untouched.
- Added page-sigilforge.js for The SigilForge page, bridging submit and feedback, storing the rune via uploadRune, and reporting overlap from findSimilar.
- forge.web.js keeps the tool's authored shorthand and full text when provided, and gained getCreations for the Ledger browse and basedOn lineage.
- embeds/sigilforge.html plus scripts/seedEmbeds.js, wired into apply.yml, seed the tool into the SiteEmbeds sigilforge row.

## 2026-06-20 — Backend moved to the modern .web.js web module

- Replaced backend/forge.jsw with backend/forge.web.js, since Wix deprecated .jsw web modules. getForgeDefinition, submitCreation, and findSimilar are now webMethod exports with explicit permissions (Anyone for the definition read, SiteMember for submit and overlap). rules.js stays a plain backend module imported by it.

## 2026-06-20 — Fix collection create: send collection.id

- createCollection.js was putting the new collection id in collection._id, which Wix Data v2 rejects with `id must not be empty`. It now sends collection.id. This also removes the old duplicate-collection behavior, since Wix no longer derives the id from the display name.

## 2026-06-20 — Component ids aligned to the tool labels

- Set ForgeComponents componentId equal to each component label so the SigilForge tool, which selects components by label, submits ids the backend validates directly. No mapping layer between tool and CMS.

## 2026-06-20 — Unified Creations collection and legacy migration

- Renamed the SigilForge submission target from Sigils to a single shared Creations collection that every forge writes to and LoreForge and the viewers read, discriminated by forgeKey and kind. Sigils was deleted.
- Added imageUrl and sourceId to the record. imageUrl carries the primary visual, sourceId records provenance for imported rows.
- Added scripts/migrate.js, an idempotent one-time migration that copies legacy LoreForgeAbilities rows into Creations, folding the build into payload, mapping loreForgeApproved to the canon track, and skipping anything already migrated. LoreForgeAbilities is left intact as a backup.
- The migration runs as the final step of the Apply workflow, so one run creates, seeds, and migrates. It is non-fatal if the legacy collection is absent.
- Repointed the backend overlap lookup, the backup fallback set, the kernel fallback definition, and the README.

## 2026-06-20 — SigilForge data, interpreter, and two-gate record

- Replaced the toy ForgeConfig and ForgeComponents seeds with the real SigilForge set: one config row and 103 components. Rider is renamed to Inlay, the spread and amplify ban flags are carried as categories, and major afflictions are tagged by cost.
- Corrected the gates to current canon. Afflictions need Tier 2 and 2nd Form. Major Afflictions and All Enemies need Tier 3 and 3rd Form. Spread needs 2nd Form. Amplify needs Tier 2. Three Targets needs 2nd Form.
- Added the Form floor so Tier cannot fall below the weapon Form, the mythic budget of 7 at Tier 3 on a 3rd Form item, and an Inlay cap that counts Spread and Amplify against the two-Inlay limit.
- Extended the interpreter with the rules it lacked: mutual exclusion, the one-Affliction sub cap, Spread requiring Secondary Targets, No Damage requiring an Inlay, and Spread and Amplify each naming an eligible Inlay with the per-component bans.
- Sigils schema gains the two-gate model and record fields: kind, canonStatus, creatorName, legality, creatorNote, fingerprint, basedOn.
- Added the CreationApprovals collection for per-campaign LoreMaster approval.
- Backend re-validates every submission, writes the legality proof and author, and exposes findSimilar for the overlap check.
- Interpreter tested against legal and illegal builds before committing.
